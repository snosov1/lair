A significant part of my life is connected to the [[https://opencv.org/][OpenCV]] library. It has a
fairly interesing history that, probably, deserves a thin printed brochure of
its own. Born in Intel, then "abandoned" to a third-party company to become
world's largest Computer Vision library, then "bought" by Intel again with
Itseez acquisition.

The main reason it became so widespread was that the library was a rock-so

You can, probably, say that in terms of backing tech businesses, the library
didn't provide stellar results. But the use of Computer Vision in established
businesses even today (not to mention 10-15 yearsa ago) is very limited in the
whole industry.
