My name is Sergei Nosov. I'm an old-school old-time hacker from Russia. I've
been programming and doing math/computer science for as long as I can remember.
I have an extensive experience in native programming languages (mainly, C++); HW
optimization for Intel CPUs and Nvidia GPUs; Computer Vision and Computer
Science.

I'm a heavy [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] user with an extensible, customizable, self-documented
[[https://github.com/snosov1/dot-emacs][configuration file]] that also has a [[https://github.com/snosov1/dot-emacs/blob/master/tutorial.org][tutorial]] for beginners (in Russian). Also,
I'm the author and maintainer of a popular Emacs package [[https://melpa.org/#/toc-org][toc-org]] for automatic
table of contents generation (and not so popular [[https://melpa.org/#/dummyparens][dummyparens]] package)

The list of public projects I've been contributing to over the years looks
something like this:

- [[https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit][OpenVINO]] [[Model Zoo][https://github.com/opencv/open_model_zoo]]. Our team has trained about one third of the "intel_models"
- OpenCV on Jetson [[https://github.com/snosov1/jetson-screencasts-sources][screencasts]]
- OpenCV [[https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/imgproc/src/clahe.cpp][CLAHE implementation]]
- [[https://github.com/Intel-Media-SDK/MediaSDK/tree/master/samples][Media SDK samples]] (in pre-open source era of Media SDK)
- [[https://bitbucket.org/digitalsphere/sphericalmirror/src/master/][VLC plugin]] for Spherical Mirror projection
- My [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/yq7p4de99knn1o0/pre-defense.pdf?dl=0][Master's Thesis]] (in Russian) "On the maximal volume of parallelotope inscribed in d-simplex" at Nizhniy Novgorod State University.

Since 2015, I read regular Saturday classes on competitive programming at
Nizhniy Novgorod school 165. Also, I have an annual lecture on [[https://github.com/UNN-VMK-Software/devtools-course-theory/tree/master/slides/09-automation]["Automation in
Software Engineering"]] (in Russian) at Nizhniy Novgorod State University (part of
the "Software Development Tools" course)
